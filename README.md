# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting
## Electric Load Curve analysis of ERCOT data


## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis of electrical load curves from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), focusing on forecasting power grid load demands to ensure reliable and feasible power supply. The analysis spans data from 2002 to 2023 across eight different zones within Texas, utilizing time series analysis techniques including deterministic trend modeling and ARIMA.

## Data
The dataset used includes load curve data from ERCOT for different zones in Texas from 2002 to 2023. Data preprocessing involved aggregation into weekly and monthly frequencies to facilitate analysis.

## Results
The project successfully applies time series analysis to forecast power demands with significant accuracy. Results include RMSE and MAPE metrics to evaluate forecast accuracy against actual observed data.

## Dependencies
- R
- R packages: forecast, tseries, MASS, pracma
